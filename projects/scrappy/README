# Data Engineering Project

This project is intended to test some common Data Engineering tasks, including crawling, data wrangling and structuring of data. The goal is to gather information about the properties of drugs from Wikipedia, structure that data so it can be used for further analysis, and provide some basic statistics about the data.

The category in Wikipedia can be found here:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Drugs_by_target_organ_system

An example of a drug from one of the subcategories is:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omeprazole

## Requirements

1) Download all the source data from Wikipedia

2) Structure the data hierarchically in a logical directory structure

3) The source HTML data for each page should be stored in the directory structure

4) There should be a JSON file for each of the drugs in the directory structure that contains the data from the data
tables on each of the wiki pages.  eg, for Omzeprazole above, the data for all of the sections in the table on the right
hand side ("Clinical data", "Legal Status", "Pharmacokinetic data", etc) should be represented in the JSON file.  This
JSON file should also contain the URL of the source data.

5) Based on the data retrieved, provide some simple stats:

- Biological half-life: max, min, average
- Percentage of drugs that have a DrugBank code
- The drug classes found

6) Provide a sample database schema for a "drugs" table (or tables, if appropriate)

7) Provide a simple Flask server that can serve up this data


## Deliverable

A zip file, containing:

1) The code that you used to do the downloading
2) The directory structure mentioned above
3) A CSV file containing the exported data
4) A README file that contains:
    - The stats from requirement #5 above
    - The DB schema from requirement #6 above


## Notes

- Your code should be written in Python 3. It can be in the form of standalone code or a Jupyter Notebook.
- The code for downloading should be parallelized (multi-process / multi-threaded)
